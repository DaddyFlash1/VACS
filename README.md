## About vACS Project
vACS is a complete rewrite of the Advanced Combat System 1.7.5, designed to provide a reliable, secure, and immersive role-playing experience. It features advanced exploit protection, webhooks for Discord, and significantly improved performance.

## What does the source contains
Our [discord bot](https://github.com/sympact06/vacs/tree/main/bot/python)
Our [API](https://github.com/sympact06/vacs/tree/main/www)
Our [Roblox Source](https://github.com/sympact06/vacs/tree/main/bot/src)

## Installing and configuration
For inexperienced developers, we highly recommend utilizing our free-to-use release of vACS. This version provides an accessible and user-friendly interface, making it easy for new developers to implement the system into their games.

However, for larger game developers with a robust development team, we suggest hosting the vACS API on a panel such as CPanel or DirectAdmin and the bot on Pterodactyl. This allows for greater customization and modification of the source code, enabling developers to tailor the system to their specific needs.

Our goal is to provide developers of all skill levels with a seamless and efficient integration process. We are committed to ensuring that our system is accessible and easy to use, while also providing advanced capabilities for experienced developers.

## Discord Bot
We are proud to use Python for our vACS Discord bot, which makes hosting and integrating our system incredibly straightforward. To get started, simply clone our repository and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary requirements.

Next, you can easily modify the API endpoints in the code to fit your specific needs. Once the necessary modifications have been made, run the bot with the command `python3 index.py`.

At our core, we strive to provide a streamlined and user-friendly experience for all developers, regardless of their skill level. By utilizing Python and a simple hosting process, we hope to make implementing vACS as easy as possible. So why not clone our repository today and get started with vACS? And don't forget to star us on Github!

## API
To utilize our API, it is necessary to have a MySQL database set up. You can locate our database at `/database/db.sql`. Once you have imported the database, you will need to connect it in each PHP file. We understand that this can be a cumbersome process, and we are actively working on streamlining this step for our users.

Additionally, it is essential to configure the SECRET to enable communication between the bot and the Roblox source with your API. We recommend taking the necessary security measures to keep your SECRET safe and secure.

Our team is committed to providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience for all of our users. As we continue to improve our platform, we will work to simplify the process of utilizing our API as much as possible.

## Source
For your convenience, we recommend utilizing our free asset and replacing vACS_Server and vACS_Func with your code. This allows for a more streamlined integration process, as the asset provides the necessary foundation for implementing vACS.

By utilizing our asset, you can quickly and easily tailor vACS to meet your specific needs without having to start from scratch. We believe that this approach will save you time and effort, allowing you to focus on creating the best possible experience for your players.

Our team is dedicated to providing developers of all skill levels with the tools they need to succeed. We hope that our free asset will help make the process of implementing vACS as straightforward and stress-free as possible.
